2. [The mind behind Linux | Linus Torvalds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8NPllzkFhE&t=16s) <br>
An interview with Linus Torvalds. I found it particularly interesting when Torvalds said that he wasn't a visionary and what he creates, he creates for himself. I vibe with that.

3. [Virtualization Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZR0rG3HKIk) <br>
Simple explanation of what virtualization does. This is what we'll be doing all semester so I thought I should, at the very least, understand what it is in general.

4. [Introduction to Cybersecurity](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-cybersecurity) <br>
A course on cybersecurity. Easy to digest lessons with a few quizzes, good pacing with enough interactivity to keep you engaged.

6. [Chmod Calculator](https://chmod-calculator.com/) <br>
"An awesome Chmod Calculator to convert Linux file permissions between different formats." is what the page says
about itself. I can confirm that it is, indeed, awesome. Played around with it for a short time, everything suddenly
became clear, it was as if i was never confused in the first place. Truly enlightening.

7. [C Pointers (With Examples)](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-pointers) <br>
