## Week 02
2. [The mind behind Linux | Linus Torvalds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8NPllzkFhE&t=16s) <br>
An interview with Linus Torvalds. I found it particularly interesting when Torvalds said that he wasn't a visionary and what he creates, he creates for himself. I vibe with that.

3. [Virtualization Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZR0rG3HKIk) <br>

## Week 04
6. [Chmod Calculator](https://chmod-calculator.com/) <br>
"An awesome Chmod Calculator to convert Linux file permissions between different formats." is what the page says
about itself. I can confirm that it is, indeed, awesome. Played around with it for a short time, everything suddenly
became clear, it was as if I was never confused in the first place. Truly enlightening.

## Week 06

An article that shows you how to compress and extract files using tar. I like that it explains what those letters mean (c, z, v, f, x, and all that stuff).
